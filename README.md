Modern Groovy Template
=====================

This is similar to the `groovy-template` but with some added items:

   * Upgrade Groovy and Spock
   * Output the Gradle version
   * Put some more logging in the tests (handy for demos)
   
Project structure is:

    <proj>
      |
      +- src
          |
          +- main
          |     |
          |     +- groovy
          |
          +- test
          |   |
          |   +- groovy

          |
